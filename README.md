# Project 1 // Leafly 

User Flow:


* Index Page/Searching

User starts at the home/index page.
They will see all the plants displayed on the right hand side, and a search filter dropdown menu with options on the left hand side.
If they change the filters, they will have to submit the changes via a button, and the page will refresh with the filtered results.
If they select a plant by clicking on it, it will take them to a new page with all the information about the plant.
Alternatively you can type a plant name into the search bar and it will take you directly to that page.


* Plant page/Commenting

From the plants page, you can view and create comments at the bottom of the page by clicking add comment/review.
This will bring up a modal that will ask for you to review the plant, and write a comment/review.
You will submit by pressing the submit.
You will then be able to delete said comment by clicking a "x" in the corner of the comment, which will bring up a confirmation window asking if you want to delete the comment or not.
